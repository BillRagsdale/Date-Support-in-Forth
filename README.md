# Date-Support-in-Forth
A tool kit in Forth supporting calendars and date calculation. Leads to ISO week numbers.
The words include DaysToDate, DayOfYear, ?LeapYear, Console input, and calculating the IDS 6801 week number for any date.
ISO weeks a used in business and finance with a Monday to Sunday arrangement. \
As you would expect most years have 52 weeks with a 53rd week about every 5-6 years.
The code used Win32Forth but only a couple of changes would be needed for other ANS Forth.
